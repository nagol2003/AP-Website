      <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This page is meant for those who want to make an addon mod for Galacticraft 4 on 1.12.2, but don't know much about forge modding or java. <br> 
            This is also meant to act as a way for me to keep track of my progress and findings and to not lose any of this information. <br> 
            Note there are many other ways to do this, but I'm only showing you the way I've done it and the best way I know how that works. <br>
            This is a step-by-step styled tutorial for the most part. Some basic understanding and experience of java is not required, but recommended. <br>
            If you wish to copy my code so you don't have to type it, my github is: <br>

        <p>1. Navigate to your NewGalaxy class located within your celestial package. These are located in the java section, not the resources section. <br>
           2. Under the class declaration "public class NewGalaxy {" add the first line: public static Galaxies (your galaxy name) <br>
           3. Then, under the "private static void build()", add the line: (your galaxy name) = BodiesRegistry.registerGalaxy("(your galaxy name)", new ResourceLocation(Const.modID, "textures/galaxy/(your galaxy name).png")); <br>
           4. Insert your 16x16 pixel png image in the resources.assets.gcaddon.textures.galaxy <br>
           It should look something like this:</p>

        <p>1. Navigate to your recipes package, located in resources.assets.gcaddon <br> 
          2. Make a .json file called something like this: MyItem <br> 
          3. Enter the code shown above or copy it from my github <br>
          4. Change the pattern. The pattern shows 3 lines of "" that represent the 3 rows in a crafting table, each with 3 spaces inside representing each slot within. <br>
          If those slots have a space, that means there is no item in that part of the crafting table. If there is a capital letter, then it means there is an item or block that belongs <br>
          5. Customize the key. Each letter in the pattern corresponds to a block or item, weather vanilla or modded. <br>
          Keep the same format I use, but you may change the letter (keep it a capital)</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Smelting Recipes:</p>
        <a href="./Resources.html" target="_blank"><img src="smelting.png"/></a>
        <p>1. Navigate to your init package within your src <br> 
          2. Open your Recipes.java class <br> 
          3. Add a smelting recipe. This is the only line of code required: GameRegistry.addSmelting(ITEM LOCATION.ITEM, new ItemStack(ITEM LOCATION.ITEM, HOW MUCH YOU GET OUT), EXPERIENCE RECIEVED.0f);</p>
